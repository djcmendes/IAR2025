This project explores the use of genetic algorithms, neural networks, and Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms — namely PPO and Recurrent PPO with LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) — for the development of an autonomous controller for the \textit{Thymio} robot. The main objective of the project is to enable the \textit{Thymio} robot to efficiently explore both simulated and real environments while avoiding collisions with obstacles and falling off cliffs. By normalizing the proximity and ground sensor readings and training in randomly generated environments, the controller learns policies that maximize spatial coverage, avoid repeated visits to the same locations, and favor smooth, forward movement.
The results showed that more complex algorithms aren't always desirable for simple problems like the one presented, achieving more unreliable results with the implementation of memory in the PPO and an ANN in the line following problem.
